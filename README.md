<h1>Recipes App: A Beginner's Journey into Angular</h1>
This repository holds the code for my first Angular project, "Recipes App". This project served as a learning ground for various core Angular concepts, and I'm excited to share it!

About the Project:

This app allows users to browse, search, and view detailed information about recipes. It incorporates features like:

Recipe listing: Search for recipes by name or browse curated categories.
Recipe details: View ingredients, instructions, and additional information for each recipe.
Authentication: Secure user accounts with login and registration functionalities.
Favorites: Save your favorite recipes for easy access.
Data persistence (optional): Implement local storage or a backend API to save user data.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

Angular
TypeScript
HTML
CSS

<h2>Key Learnings:</h2>

Data binding and directives: Manipulate data flow and DOM elements dynamically.<br>
Services and pipes: Create reusable logic and data transformations.<br>
HTTP client and Observables: Fetch data from external APIs asynchronously.<br>
Routing: Navigate between different views and handle URL changes.<br>
Authentication: Implement secure user login and management.<br>
Forms: Build reactive and template-driven forms for user interaction.<br>

<h2>Development Journey:</h2>

This project started as part of a Udemy course on Angular. Throughout the process, I encountered challenges and gained valuable insights:

Understanding complex concepts: Breaking down intricate concepts like Observables and routing into smaller, digestible pieces.<br>
Debugging and problem-solving: Learning to effectively identify and resolve errors in my code.<br>
Applying theory to practice: Putting my theoretical knowledge into action through real-world implementation.<br>
